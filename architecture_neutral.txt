One theory from architecture is the "Form Follows Function" theory, which suggests that the design of a building should be based on its intended purpose or function. This theory was popularized by American architect Louis Sullivan in the late 19th century and has since become a fundamental principle in modern architecture.

According to this theory, the design of a building should prioritize its function over its aesthetics. The form of the building should be a direct result of its intended use, and the design should be optimized to meet the needs of its occupants. For example, a hospital should be designed with the needs of patients and medical staff in mind, with features such as wide hallways, ample natural light, and easy access to medical equipment.

This theory has been applied to a wide range of architectural styles, from modernist buildings to traditional structures. It has also influenced other design fields, such as product design and graphic design, where the function of the object is considered before its visual appearance.

Overall, the "Form Follows Function" theory emphasizes the importance of practicality and functionality in architecture, and has had a significant impact on the way buildings are designed and constructed.
